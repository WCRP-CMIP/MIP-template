## General Questions

??? question "What is Your MIP?"
    Your MIP is a Model Intercomparison Project that coordinates climate model experiments focused on [topic]. It is part of CMIP, organized by the World Climate Research Programme.

??? question "How do I participate?"
    Modeling groups can participate by:
    
    1. Reviewing the [Experiment Design](../experiments/design.md)
    2. Running the required experiments
    3. Publishing data through ESGF
    4. Contacting the [Steering Committee](../about/committee.md)

??? question "Is my model eligible?"
    Any Earth system model or climate model participating in CMIP can contribute. Contact the co-chairs if you have questions about eligibility.

## Data Questions

??? question "Where can I find Your MIP data?"
    Data is available through the [ESGF portal](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/). Search for experiment names listed in our [Experiment Design](../experiments/design.md).

??? question "How should I cite the data?"
    Please cite:
    
    - The relevant protocol paper
    - Individual model datasets per CMIP guidelines
    - See [Publications](../about/publications.md) for details

??? question "What variables are available?"
    See our [Data Requirements](../experiments/data.md) page for the complete list of requested variables.

## Technical Questions

??? question "What forcing datasets should I use?"
    Use the official CMIP7 forcing datasets. Details are in the [Experiment Design](../experiments/design.md).

??? question "What is the experiment naming convention?"
    Experiment names follow the pattern `your-mip-exp-name`. See the experiment tables in [Experiment Design](../experiments/design.md).
