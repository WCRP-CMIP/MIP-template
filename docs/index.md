## About Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs)

Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) are coordinated climate modeling activities that bring together modeling groups from around the world to address specific scientific questions. MIPs are essential for:

- **Advancing Climate Science**: By comparing different models running the same experiments, we can better understand climate processes and reduce uncertainties in climate projections
- **Standardizing Methodologies**: MIPs establish common protocols, forcing datasets, and output requirements that enable meaningful comparisons across models
- **Building Community**: They foster collaboration among modeling centers, creating a shared infrastructure for climate research
- **Supporting Policy**: MIP results, particularly from CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project), form the scientific basis for IPCC assessment reports

## Using This Template

This template provides a ready-to-use website structure for your MIP using MkDocs with the modern Shadcn theme.

### Activating GitHub Pages

To publish your MIP documentation website:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select the `gh-pages` branch
4. Select the `/ (root)` folder
5. Click **Save**

Your site will be published at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

### Finding Your Website

Once GitHub Pages is activated:

- Your site will be available at the URL shown in the GitHub Pages settings
- The site will automatically update whenever you push changes to the `main` branch
- Multiple versions are supported through mike (see developer documentation)
